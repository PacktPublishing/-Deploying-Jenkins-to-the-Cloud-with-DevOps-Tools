# Deploying Jenkins to the Cloud with DevOps Tools [Video]
This is the code repository for [Deploying Jenkins to the Cloud with DevOps Tools [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/deploying-jenkins-cloud-devops-tools-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788839778), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Jenkins is one of the most popular Continuous Integration servers on the market today. It was designed to maintain, secure, communicate, test, build, and improve the software development process.
We begin by looking on different AWS services and how you can use them for Continuous Integration. We'll see how Ansible can help to deploy an entire system to AWS for an almost production-ready CI system in the cloud. We then customize and configure your Jenkins master automatically on boot-up with Groovy code in order to achieve the build process we want. This includes adding secrets to the credentials store, installing and configuring plugins, and setting some basic values within the Jenkins main configuration. Once we are able to interact with Gitlab, we will then configure a way to run Jenkins nodes on Kubernetes so that we can actually build our software.
When everything looks good in our development environment, we will then see what an almost production-ready CI system in the cloud looks like, especially with regard to security aspects.

We cover aspects of Continuous Testing: Unit Test Execution, Functional Testing, and Load Testing
We explore effective ways to manage and monitor Jenkins. You will see how to run jobs different types of slave and how to deploy a system to AWS with Ansible and with Docker on Kubernetes.
